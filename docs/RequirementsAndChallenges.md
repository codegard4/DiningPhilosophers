# Requirements and Challenges

## Requirements
Here we include the project requirements that were relevant to the coding portion of this project:
- [x] Groups should preferably be 2 (3 students at most)
  - **Our group consists of 2 students
- [x] The solution must be uploaded to GitHub and the location of the
repository emailed to the professor PRIOR to the presentation
  - Link emailed on 2025-03-21
- [x] Each student will grade both themselves and their partners although
final grades will be at my discretion.
  - We will grade each other after the presentation

## Challenges
- **Separation of duties**: When initially setting up the project there wasn't a simple way to split up tasks. We dealt with this by talking through problems, laying out pseudocode on one person's computer, and delegating tasks to complete going forward. 
- **Deadlock avoidance**: A version of our philosopher's code for grabbing chopsticks had the possibility of deadlock. We knew this logically, but it was challenging to make the deadlock occur (needed to implement randomness, lower number of philosophers, and lower eat and think time). Once creating the deadlock circumstance we were able to debug and fix the program.
